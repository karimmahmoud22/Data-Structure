# Data Structure Labs using C++

## Overview
This repository contains C++ implementations of various data structures commonly used in computer science and software development. The data structures included in this repository are designed to provide efficient storage and retrieval of data, as well as support for common operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

## Data Structures Implemented
The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Trees (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
6. Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, etc.)
7. Hash Tables

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the C++ source files.
3. Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) to compile the source files.
4. Execute the compiled executable to run the data structure implementations.
5. Follow the prompts or use the provided API to interact with the implemented data structures.
6. Test various scenarios and operations to evaluate the functionality and performance of the data structures.
